    <summary>An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.  Almost all
 activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of
 creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.SetContentView(Android.Views.View)" /></c>.  While activities are often presented to the user
 as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating
 windows (via a theme with <c><see cref="!:NoType:android/R$attr;Href=../../../reference/android/R.attr.html#windowIsFloating" /></c> set)
 or embedded inside of another activity (using <c><see cref="T:Android.App.ActivityGroup" /></c>).

 There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:

 <list type="bullet"><item><term><c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnCreate(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> is where you initialize your activity.  Most
     importantly, here you will usually call <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.SetContentView(System.Int32)" /></c>
     with a layout resource defining your UI, and using <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.FindViewById(System.Int32)" /></c>
     to retrieve the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with
     programmatically.

     </term></item><item><term><c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c> is where you deal with the user leaving your
     activity.  Most importantly, any changes made by the user should at this
     point be committed (usually to the
     <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.ContentProvider" /></c> holding the data).

      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Activities in the system are managed as an <i>activity stack</i>.
 When a new activity is started, it is placed on the top of the stack
 and becomes the running activity -- the previous activity always remains
 below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until
 the new activity exits.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">An activity has essentially four states:<list type="bullet"><item><term> If an activity in the foreground of the screen (at the top of
         the stack),
         it is <i>active</i> or  <i>running</i>. </term></item><item><term>If an activity has lost focus but is still visible (that is, a new non-full-sized
         or transparent activity has focus on top of your activity), it
         is <i>paused</i>. A paused activity is completely alive (it
         maintains all state and member information and remains attached to
         the window manager), but can be killed by the system in extreme
         low memory situations.
     </term></item><item><term>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity,
         it is <i>stopped</i>. It still retains all state and member information,
         however, it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden
         and it will often be killed by the system when memory is needed
         elsewhere.</term></item><item><term>If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop the activity
         from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its
         process.  When it is displayed again to the user, it must be
         completely restarted and restored to its previous state.</term></item></list></para>

 perform operations when the Activity moves between states.  The colored

      </para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your
 activity:

 <list type="bullet"><item><term>The <format type="text/html"><b>entire lifetime</b></format> of an activity happens between the first call
 to <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnCreate(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> through to a single final call
 to <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnDestroy" /></c>.  An activity will do all setup
 of "global" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in
 onDestroy().  For example, if it has a thread running in the background
 to download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate()
 and then stop the thread in onDestroy().

 </term></item><item><term>The <format type="text/html"><b>visible lifetime</b></format> of an activity happens between a call to
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnStart" /></c> until a corresponding call to
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnStop" /></c>.  During this time the user can see the
 activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting
 with the user.  Between these two methods you can maintain resources that
 are needed to show the activity to the user.  For example, you can register
 a <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.BroadcastReceiver" /></c> in onStart() to monitor for changes
 that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no
 longer sees what you are displaying.  The onStart() and onStop() methods
 can be called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden
 to the user.

 </term></item><item><term>The <format type="text/html"><b>foreground lifetime</b></format> of an activity happens between a call to
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnResume" /></c> until a corresponding call to
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c>.  During this time the activity is
 in front of all other activities and interacting with the user.  An activity
 can frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when
 the device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new
 intent is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly
 lightweight.
 </term></item></list></para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following
 Activity methods.  All of these are hooks that you can override
 to do appropriate work when the activity changes state.  All
 activities will implement <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnCreate(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c>
 to do their initial setup; many will also implement
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c> to commit changes to data and
 otherwise prepare to stop interacting with the user.  You should always
 call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.</para>

 See the 
 section for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied
 to the activities it is hosting.  Note that it is important to save
 persistent data in <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c> instead of <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnSaveInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c>

 applications targeting platforms starting with <c><see cref="!:NoType:android/os/Build$VERSION_CODES;Href=../../../reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html#HONEYCOMB" /></c>
 vs. those targeting prior platforms.  Starting with Honeycomb, an application

      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">If the configuration of the device (as defined by the
 <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.Res.Configuration" /></c> class) changes,
 then anything displaying a user interface will need to update to match that
 configuration.  Because Activity is the primary mechanism for interacting
 with the user, it includes special support for handling configuration
 changes.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change
 in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your
 current activity to be <i>destroyed</i>, going through the normal activity
 lifecycle process of <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c>,
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnStop" /></c>, and <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnDestroy" /></c> as appropriate.  If the activity
 had been in the foreground or visible to the user, once <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnDestroy" /></c> is
 called in that instance then a new instance of the activity will be
 created, with whatever savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated
 from <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnSaveInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c>.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">This is done because any application resource,
 including layout files, can change based on any configuration value.  Thus
 the only safe way to handle a configuration change is to re-retrieve all
 resources, including layouts, drawables, and strings.  Because activities
 must already know how to save their state and re-create themselves from
 that state, this is a convenient way to have an activity restart itself
 with a new configuration.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your
 activity based on one or more types of configuration changes.  This is
 done with the <c><see cref="!:NoType:android/R$attr;Href=../../../reference/android/R.attr.html#configChanges" /></c>
 attribute in its manifest.  For any types of configuration changes you say
 that you handle there, you will receive a call to your current activity's
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnConfigurationChanged(Android.Content.Res.Configuration)" /></c> method instead of being restarted.  If
 a configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the
 activity will still be restarted and <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnConfigurationChanged(Android.Content.Res.Configuration)" /></c>
 will not be called.</para>

 which describes the activity
 to be executed.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it

 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.StartActivityForResult(Android.Content.Intent, System.Int32)" /></c>
 version with a second integer parameter identifying the call.  The result
 will come back through your <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnActivityResult(System.Int32, Android.App.Result, Android.App.Result)" /></c>

      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">There are generally two kinds of persistent state than an activity
 will deal with: shared document-like data (typically stored in a SQLite
 database using a <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.ContentProvider" /></c>)
 and internal state such as user preferences.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">For content provider data, we suggest that activities use a
 "edit in place" user model.  That is, any edits a user makes are effectively
 made immediately without requiring an additional confirmation step.
 Supporting this model is generally a simple matter of following two rules:<list type="bullet"><item><term /></item><item><term /></item></list></para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for
             it is created immediately.  For example, if the user chooses to write
             a new e-mail, a new entry for that e-mail is created as soon as they
             start entering data, so that if they go to any other activity after
             that point this e-mail will now appear in the list of drafts.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">When an activity's <c>onPause()</c> method is called, it should

             your data even more aggressively at key times during your
             activity's lifecycle: for example before starting a new

             switches between input fields, etc.</para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">This model is designed to prevent data loss when a user is navigating
 between activities, and allows the system to safely kill an activity (because
 system resources are needed somewhere else) at any time after it has been

 that the user pressing BACK from your activity does <i>not</i>
 mean "cancel" -- it means to leave the activity with its current contents

 preferences that are shared across multiple application components
 (activities, receivers, services, providers), you can use the underlying
 <c><see cref="M:Android.Content.Context.GetSharedPreferences(System.String, Android.Content.FileCreationMode)" /></c> method
 to retrieve a preferences

 <format type="text/html"><h3>Process Lifecycle</h3></format></para>
      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">The Android system attempts to keep application process around for as
 long as possible, but eventually will need to remove old processes when
 memory runs low.  As described in , the decision about which process to remove is intimately
 tied to the state of the user's interaction with it.  In general, there
 are four states a process can be in based on the activities running in it,
 listed here in order of importance.  The system will kill less important
 processes (the last ones) before it resorts to killing more important
 processes (the first ones).

 <list type="number"><item><term>The <format type="text/html"><b>foreground activity</b></format> (the activity at the top of the screen
 that the user is currently interacting with) is considered the most important.
 Its process will only be killed as a last resort, if it uses more memory
 than is available on the device.  Generally at this point the device has
 reached a memory paging state, so this is required in order to keep the user
 interface responsive.
 </term></item><item><term>A <format type="text/html"><b>visible activity</b></format> (an activity that is visible to the user
 but not in the foreground, such as one sitting behind a foreground dialog)
 is considered extremely important and will not be killed unless that is
 required to keep the foreground activity running.
 </term></item><item><term>A <format type="text/html"><b>background activity</b></format> (an activity that is not visible to
 the user and has been paused) is no longer critical, so the system may
 safely kill its process to reclaim memory for other foreground or
 visible processes.  If its process needs to be killed, when the user navigates
 back to the activity (making it visible on the screen again), its
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnCreate(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> method will be called with the savedInstanceState it had previously
 supplied in <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnSaveInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> so that it can restart itself in the same
 state as the user last left it.
 </term></item><item><term>An <format type="text/html"><b>empty process</b></format> is one hosting no activities or other
 application components (such as <c><see cref="T:Android.App.Service" /></c> or
 <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.BroadcastReceiver" /></c> classes).  These are killed very
 quickly by the system as memory becomes low.  For this reason, any
 background operation you do outside of an activity must be executed in the
 context of an activity BroadcastReceiver or Service to ensure that the system
 knows it needs to keep your process around.
 </term></item></list></para>

      <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Sometimes an Activity may need to do a long-running operation that exists
 independently of the activity lifecycle itself.  An example may be a camera
 application that allows you to upload a picture to a web site.  The upload
 may take a long time, and the application should allow the user to leave
 the application will it is executing.  To accomplish this, your Activity
 should start a <c><see cref="T:Android.App.Service" /></c> in which the upload takes place.  This allows
 the system to properly prioritize your process (considering it to be more
 important than other non-visible applications) for the duration of the
 upload, independent of whether the original activity is paused, stopped,
 or finished.

 </para>
          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">This callback is mostly used for saving any persistent state the
 activity is editing, to present a "edit in place" model to the user and
 making sure nothing is lost if there are not enough resources to start
 the new activity without first killing this one.  This is also a good
 place to do things like stop animations and other things that consume a
 noticeable amount of CPU in order to make the switch to the next activity
 as fast as possible, or to close resources that are exclusive access
 such as the camera.

 </para>

 processes to reclaim resources.  Because of this, you should be sure
 that all of your state is saved by the time you return from

          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">This function is called purely as an optimization, and you must
 not rely on it being called.  When it is called, a number of guarantees
 will be made to help optimize configuration switching:
 <list type="bullet"><item><term> The function will be called between <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnStop" /></c> and
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnDestroy" /></c>.

 </para>
          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">This method is called before an activity may be killed so that when it
 comes back some time in the future it can restore its state.  For example,
 if activity B is launched in front of activity A, and at some point activity
 A is killed to reclaim resources, activity A will have a chance to save the
 current state of its user interface via this method so that when the user
 returns to activity A, the state of the user interface can be restored
 via <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnCreate(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> or <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnRestoreInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c>.

 </para>

 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c>, which is always called when an activity is being placed
 in the background or on its way to destruction, or <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnStop" /></c> which
 is called before destruction.  One example of when <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c> and
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnStop" /></c> is called and not this method is when a user navigates back
 from activity B to activity A: there is no need to call <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnSaveInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c>
 on B because that particular instance will never be restored, so the
 system avoids calling it.  An example when <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnPause" /></c> is called and
 not <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnSaveInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> is when activity B is launched in front of activity A:
 the system may avoid calling <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnSaveInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> on activity A if it isn't
 killed during the lifetime of B since the state of the user interface of
 A will stay intact.

 </para>
          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">The default implementation takes care of most of the UI per-instance
 state for you by calling <c><see cref="M:Android.Views.View.OnSaveInstanceState" /></c> on each

 focused view (all of which is restored by the default implementation of
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnRestoreInstanceState(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c>).  If you override this method to save additional

 call through to the default implementation, otherwise be prepared to save
 all of the state of each view yourself.

        <remarks>
          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Report to the system that your app is now fully drawn, purely for diagnostic
 purposes (calling it does not impact the visible behavior of the activity).
 This is only used to help instrument application launch times, so that the
 app can report when it is fully in a usable state; without this, the only thing
 the system itself can determine is the point at which the activity's window
 is <i>first</i> drawn and displayed.  To participate in app launch time
 measurement, you should always call this method after first launch (when
 <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.OnCreate(Android.OS.Bundle)" /></c> is called), at the point where you have
 entirely drawn your UI and populated with all of the significant data.  You
 can safely call this method any time after first launch as well, in which case
 it will simply be ignored.

          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Launch an activity for which you would like a result when it finished.
 When this activity exits, your
 onActivityResult() method will be called with the given requestCode.
 Using a negative requestCode is the same as calling
 <c><see cref="!:Android.App.Activity.startActivity(android.content.Intent)" /></c> (the activity is not launched as a sub-activity).

 </para>
          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Note that this method should only be used with Intent protocols
 that are defined to return a result.  In other protocols (such as
 <c><see cref="F:Android.Content.Intent.ActionMain" /></c> or <c><see cref="F:Android.Content.Intent.ActionView" /></c>), you may
 not get the result when you expect.  For example, if the activity you
 are launching uses the singleTask launch mode, it will not run in your
 task and thus you will immediately receive a cancel result.

 </para>
          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">As a special case, if you call startActivityForResult() with a requestCode
 &gt;= 0 during the initial onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)/onResume() of your
 activity, then your window will not be displayed until a result is
 returned back from the started activity.  This is to avoid visible
 flickering when redirecting to another activity.

          <para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Request to put this Activity in a mode where the user is locked to the
 current task.

 This will prevent the user from launching other apps, going to settings,
 or reaching the home screen.

 If <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Admin.DevicePolicyManager.IsLockTaskPermitted(System.String)" /></c> returns true
 for this component then the app will go directly into Lock Task mode.  The user
 will not be able to exit this mode until <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Activity.StopLockTask" /></c> is called.

 If <c><see cref="M:Android.App.Admin.DevicePolicyManager.IsLockTaskPermitted(System.String)" /></c> returns false
 then the system will prompt the user with a dialog requesting permission to enter
 this mode.  When entered through this method the user can exit at any time through
 an action described by the request dialog.  Calling stopLockTask will also exit the
 mode.
